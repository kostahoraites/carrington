carrington.py makes plots of a single frame
 -sbatch carrington.sh calls carrington.py for a single time, makes plots in the plots/ directory
 -sbatch carrington_movie.sh calls carrington.py in an array job
  -modifying carrington_movie.sh changes the run (EGI, EGL, etc.) and the number of frames
   -these can be made into movie files using the ffmpeg tool, e.g.:
       ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i 'proton_DEF/*/azim_frame_*_00500_ev_traced.png' -vcodec libx264 egl_azim_frame_00500_ev_traced.mp4
    -and then converted into a .gif file using the 'convert' command line tool
